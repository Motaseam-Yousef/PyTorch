# Mastering Data Science and Deep Learning with Python

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to data science and deep learning using Python. You will learn how to format data into arrays using NumPy, manipulate and clean data with pandas, understand machine learning principles, and apply them using the PyTorch deep learning library.

## What you'll learn:

- **NumPy for Data Formatting:** Learn how to use NumPy, a powerful library in Python for numerical computations, to format data into arrays.

- **Data Manipulation with pandas:** Get hands-on experience with pandas, a Python library commonly used for data manipulation and analysis. You'll learn how to clean, transform, and visualize your data.

- **Machine Learning Principles:** Get a strong understanding of classic machine learning theory principles. This knowledge will be essential when you start creating complex machine learning models.

- **Deep Learning with PyTorch:** Utilize PyTorch, one of the leading deep learning libraries, to create and train models for image classification.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks with PyTorch:** Understand and implement Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for handling sequence and time-series data.

- **Deep Learning Models for Tabular Data:** Learn how to use state-of-the-art deep learning models to analyze and draw insights from tabular data.

## Prerequisites

This course assumes that you have basic knowledge of Python. Prior experience with libraries like NumPy and pandas will be helpful but is not required.
