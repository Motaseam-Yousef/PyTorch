For these exercises we'll perform a binary classification on the Census Income dataset available from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
The goal is to determine if an individual earns more than $50K based on a set of continuous and categorical variables.

IMPORTANT NOTE! Make sure you don't run the cells directly above the example output shown,
otherwise you will end up writing over the example output!
